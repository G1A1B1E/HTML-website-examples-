      If you want to display a spreadsheet on your site, let Tableizer! transform your data into an HTML table. Just paste the raw data from Excel, Google Doc, or any other spreadsheet into the converter tool at tableizer.journalistopia.com. Tweak the table options, then click Tableize It to receive the HTML output.
This is perhaps one of the coolest HTML codes for your website, as Tableize It! does all the hard work.
Click Copy HTML to Clipboard to copy the HTML code and add it to your website. Consider editing the background-colors to make it look a lot cooler.
While this is not really an HTML effect, it's quite handy.
